Motivation
Sedentary lifestyle is detrimental to health
The covid-19 pandemic has resulted in people adopting a more sedentary lifestyle due to work-from-home jobs for adults as well as online learning for students. This sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for diseases and premature death in the future and a healthy lifestyle needs to be promoted to reduce the risk. Studies show that developing a habit when the individual is younger has a greater likelihood of it being continued into their adult life. University life is a great time for individuals to pick up sports and other physical activities that contribute to a healthy lifestyle.
Challenging for introverts and beginners to do sports with others
It can be challenging for introverts and beginners to join in sports sessions as they might feel socially awkward or uncomfortable with the skill level. Also, sport cliques tend to form easily in school and it can be hard for others to join in, especially if they are not confident nor sociable.
Challenging to find sufficient people to do sports
It can also be challenging for people to find sufficient people to do sports together. For example, a game of field soccer requires 22 people minimum and a game of volleyball requires 12 people minimum. While some people can have friends that play the same sport, it can be challenging to find enough people that are available at a common time to play together. 
Overall motivation
Hence our first motivation is to inculcate the healthy habit of exercising and playing sports in university students for them to bring into their adult life. This healthy habit will reduce risk factors for health problems and implications.

Our second motivation comes from seeing individuals who are curious and open to trying sports but yet are discouraged by their shyness and lack of confidence. Having a community and an application that can help them join in sports sessions easily would definitely be beneficial in building up sporting habits.

Our third motivation stems from seeing sports sessions being canceled due to lack of participation. For example, in residential colleges, there are sports sessions held weekly and some weeks there are not enough people in the residential college to hold a meaningful session. Whilst open invitations on social media platforms and by word of mouth can help, having a dedicated community and application that can facilitate the finding of members can increase the frequency of sports sessions held.
Aims
We aim to create a social platform mobile application across iOS and Android which will provide users with the ability to host or find sport sessions. Users will be verified and have their sports profile along with basic information stored on the platform for others to view.

On top of being able to find sessions and users manually, we will automatically track listings for both hosting and finding to match eligible users to sports sessions. This matching will be done via sports type, skill level and preferred locations so that the suggestion will be relevant to the user.

We also aim to create a media sharing platform where users can post content relating to sports to generate discussion, be it to get advice on ways to improve or to simply share a nice clip with the rest of the community.
